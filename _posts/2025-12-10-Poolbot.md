## Overview
PoolBot is a physics-aware mobile manipulation system for autonomous billiards, developed as the final project for MIT 6.4210: Robotic Manipulation. The system is designed to plan and execute **multi-shot pool sequences** on a standard pool table by reasoning about ball dynamics, robot motion, and manipulation constraints. The project was completed by **Avi Naurla, Suraj Reddy, and me**, and emphasizes integrating perception, physics-based planning, and mobile manipulation into a single autonomous system.
